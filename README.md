# Poker-Analytics
## Description 
- A direct implementation of **hand strength estimation**, **hand potential**, and **effective hand strength** functions for hands in No-Limit Hold’em (NLH) poker using **enumeration methods** in Python (information taken from [this paper](https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/1998/AAAI98-070.pdf))
- Developed Monte Carlo simulation-based functions for preflop hand analysis with a 3% margin of error and generated visualizations to display results
- The Deuces library has been used for for game simulation, hand evaluation etc.
Refer to `poker_report.pdf` for comprehensive information on all of the material and explanation of the code written for this project

## How to Run Code
There are separate files for each function, but `simulation.py` is an amalgamation of all the functions.
Run `python3 simulation.py` to simulate preflop and postflop hand simulations for every function.
